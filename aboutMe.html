            <p>
                Hello! My name is Cassidy Carter and I am a Junior at Rhode Island School of Design majoring in Graphic Design. I enjoy drawing,
                photography, and getting to know people. I started this blog as a project for school but found I loved sharing
                my experiences as an art student and in life. I am a part of the Women in Tech organization at my school.
                I have helped in designing websites and tech gear with several companies around Rhode Island. I enjoy retro
                technology but find that I design in modern style. Below is a design I made for a local company in Rhode
                Island (more designs I did can be found in Tech Tips) I code in HTML and CSS for my websites, on the most
                part, but I also code in Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and Rust. Feel free to email me any questions you
                might have on these topics or on my designs! My information is on the Home and About sections of this blog.
                I would love to hear your feedback and your own experiences! Contact information below.
